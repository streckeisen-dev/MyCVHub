# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Node.js 22+
- yarn 4+ (run `corepack enable` if not yet enabled)
- Docker (for local testing)
- Cloudinary account (for profile picture storage)
- GitHub OAuth app (for GitHub 3rd party login)
- Mailgun Account (for email notifications)

## Local Development

MyCVHub requires a PostgreSQL database, which you can conveniently start by running:
```bash
docker compose up postgres
```

To run the backend individually, you can use your IDE's spring boot run configuration (you will need to set up all required env variables, a list of which can be found in the `.env.example` file).

To run the frontend individually, go to the `frontend` directory and run:
```bash
yarn dev
```

You can also run all MyCVHub components at once by using Docker compose.
Before you can run the backend with docker, you need to create a `.env` containing the required environment variables.
```bash
docker compose up
```

## Frontend Testing
The frontend is tested with both unit tests and Cypress component tests.
To run all frontend unit tests, execute:
```bash
yarn test
```

To run the Cypress component tests, execute:
```bash
yarn cypress
```
